		<h2>Lucille</h2>
		<p>
			Lucille is a server at Bob's restaurant. One of the most frustrating parts of her job, aside
			from the customers, is the scheduling abiguity. When she needs time off, she either texts Bob
			or tells him in person when they happen to be at the restaurant at the same time. If she wants to
			find someone to cover her shift, she mass texts all her co-workers. When the new
			schedule comes out, she manually enters the shifts she is scheduled to work in to google calendars,
			which is her preferred time management tool.
