		<h2>Talia, 27, fast-food worker</h2>

			<li>Talia wants to access her work schedule anywhere/anytime</li>
			<li>Talia wants to be able to schedule time off.</li>
			<li>Talia wants to volunteer to pick up a shift.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Frustrations</h3>
		<p>Talia likes her job well enough but she frequently has problems with her work schedule.  When she wants to make plans with her friends she has to either call in to find the shift manager or physically go in to her workplace the Sunday before to see the paper schedule fixed to the wall by her manager.  Also when she wants to volunteer to pick up a shift she has to either call in or go in to put her name on a physical list.
