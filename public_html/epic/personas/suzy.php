		over 10 locations ever day, Suzy finds her current scheduling solution doesn't cut it. She
		needs some way to generate a schedule according to the above critera while accounting for
			an employees availablity and preference. She would also like it to keep track of the
			hours each employee works as well as their pay rate.

			tuning the schedule. She can now handle all shift trade request and time off requests
			for her phone on her lunch break.
