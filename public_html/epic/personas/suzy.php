		<h1>Persona</h1>
		<h2>Suzy</h2>
		<p>
			Suzy is the manager of a large firm that sends small teams to several physical locations
			daily to preform a service. Each team requires a specialist A and a specialist B, an
			employee can ether be a specialist A, specialist B, or an apprentice. And there must be a
			1 to 1 ratio fo specialists to apprentices.  Managing over 50 employees, and a schedule of
			over 10 locations ever day, Suzy finds her current scheduling solution doesn't cut it. She
			needs some way to generate a schedule according to the above criteria while accounting for
			an employees availability and preference. She would also like it to keep track of the
			hours each employee works as well as their pay rate. Since there is a geographic component
			to task, she also thinks it would be helpful if the software could route the teams to
			their.
		</p>
		<h2>Use Case</h2>
		<p>
			Suzy will spend an hour or so during her work week, generating and fine tuning the schedule on her
			office desktop. Employees can upload their schedule preferences and she can generate schedule designs,
			that meet the criteria for the project, from the push of a button, as well generate maps to and from locations.
			She can then distribute these schedules and maps by way of email or sync with an application like
			google maps. Suzy rarely gets requests for schedule alterations, bun she can now handle all shift trade
			request for her phone on her lunch break, using the mobile app.
