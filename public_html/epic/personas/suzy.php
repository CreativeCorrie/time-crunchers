		<p>
		Suzy is the manager of a large firm that sends small teams to several physical locations
		daily to preform a service. Each team requires a specialist A and a specialist B, an
		employee can ether be a specialist A, specialist B, or an apprentice. And there must be a
		1 to 1 ratio fo specialists to apprentices.  Managing over 50 employees, and a schedule of
		over 10 locations ever day, Suzy finds her current scheduling solution doesn't cut it.
