		<h1>Suzy Hughes</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Age: 32</li>
			<li>Education: Masters of Business Administration</li>
			<li>Occupation: Manager</li>
			<li>Income: $120,000 annual</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Work/Life/Balance:</h2>
		<p>
			Suzy Hughes runs her own business as a head contractor with a team of fifty sub-contractors and ten separate locations.  She has to keep track of her own schedule and of all of the sites she is responsible for.  Each contractor under her also has a schedule they make up on their own and are responsible for.  She needs to keep track of the hours each employee works as well as their pay rate.  Hughes wants to ensure the number of different types of employees stays within the company's prescribed ratio to meet the needs of the business.  Hughes attends meetings all around the state and she needs to keep track of her work schedule and needs for each appointment.  Hughes has several schedules she needs to stay on top of each day not to mention her own personal time. Hughes travels all over the southwest and is an avid rock climber.  When she is in the area, Suzy loves to visit the pueblos and any public events they are doing.  She would like to be able to add her recreation time to her schedule, so when she is visiting a site she can also schedule time for a side trip as well.  It would be a boon for Hughes to be able to have her bill paying calendar integrated with her personal schedule so she isn't hit with surprises at the end of the month.

		<h2>Goals:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>To improve her productivity and abilities in handling the scheduling of her crews.</li>
			<li>The ability to respond to schedule changes quickly and easily.</li>
			<li>Being able to manage several schedules at once.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Needs:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>To quickly find helpful and accurate scheduling information when needed.</li>
			<li>To efficiently utilize the small amount of time she has fr scheduling details.</li>
			<li>To respond to the ebb and flow of business demands  with agility by getting her employees when and where she needs them.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Challenges:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Overwhelmed by the idea that she has to know everything about everybody and keep it all straight so she doesn't hurt anyone's tender ego.</li>
			<li>Worried about her competence in keeping up with new technology especially when it changes so fast and radically.</li>
			<li>Frustrated at times when she can't find or re-find things in her overcrowded calendar.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Technology:</h2>
		Hughes runs with an iPhone6, two laptops with the latest version of Windows and Microsoft Office and 1 tablet mostly for Netflix when she is away from home.

		<h2>Story:</h2>
		Suzy Hughes absolutely loves her job. She feels very fortunate to be where she is and with the experiences and adventure she has acquired over just 32 years.  She enjoys the challenges of finding answers to a wide variety of questions. She is always learning alongside her colleagues and staff and is deeply appreciative of the range of knowledge acquired in her daily work.

		Unfortunately, Hughes is unable to follow cutting edge development as much as she would like. The majority of work is spent in public service in the field and she doesn't have time to enrich her knowledge base with a lot of personal research. It's often a decision between keeping her business going and exploring technological advancement. As expected, the former always wins out. Her customers don't care how she gets it all done, just that she does.
