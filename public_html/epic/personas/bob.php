		<h1>Persona</h1>
		<h2>Bob</h2>
		<p>
			Bob is the the owner of a restaurant, he has 18 employees. He finds he spends
			a lot of excess time on scheduling his employees' work shifts, accommodating their
			schedule requests and preferences, and keeping track of their hours.  His employees
			are always blowing up his phone, requesting a schedule change, that he often has
			to coordinate.
			With time-crunchers he generate a schedulesjfgh from his personal Mac Book, either
			from home or the manager's office at the restaurant.
			The schedules will take into account any schedule requests and preferences his staff have
			submitted to the time crunchers data base. After the schedules are distributed, his employees
			can coordinate amongst themselves in trading shifts, and he can utilize the mobile app, at his
			own leisure to approve or disapprove the requests.
