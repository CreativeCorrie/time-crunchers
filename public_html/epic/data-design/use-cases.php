			from home or the manager's office at the restaurant.
			The schedules will take into account any schedule requests and preferences his staff have
			submitted to the time crunchers data base. After the schedules are distributed, his employees
			can coordinate amongst themselves in trading shifts, and he can utilize the mobile app, at his
			own leisure to approve or disapprove the requests.
