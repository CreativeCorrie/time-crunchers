<h2>Regarding Time Crunch</h2>
<p>
		Time Crunch was created as a class project for the CNM Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp. The Original Idea was proposed by Tacos Findley, who knew how to keep things crisp and fresh. Eventually, Time Crunchers was formed by Samuel V. Chandler, Denzyl Fontaine, Corrie Hooker, Elaine Thomas and Derek Mauldin. The Time Crunch application was conceived to solve recurring problems that are inherent to schedule management for both a base user and an admin user with elevated privileges. A base user (employee)	can view their schedule and crew anytime and make requests that will be sent to the schedule admin (manager). The admin (manager) will be able to create, view, update and delete users, crews and schedules.
