						We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us.
						How do you know she is a witch? â€¦Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Well, we did do the nose.
						Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government.
						Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic
						ceremony.

						I am your king. Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! You don't
						frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at
						you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!
						Why?

						Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Be quiet! Well, we did do
						the nose. Did you dress her up like this? And the hat. She's a witch!

						Bloody Peasant!
						Shut up! Will you shut up?!
						Why?

						How do you know she is a witch?

						Burn her! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in
						your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave
						before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

						She looks like one.
						It's only a model.
						Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government.
						Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic
						ceremony.

						The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the
						bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is
						why I am your king. Well, I didn't vote for you.

						We want a shrubbery!! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water!
						I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now
						leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

						Where'd you get the coconuts? The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Shut up! Will you shut up?!
						Burn her!

						And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Why? You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause
						some watery tart threw a sword at you! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride
						to Camelot!

						Burn her! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. We shall say
						'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. I don't want
						to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction!
						Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt
						you a second time!

						You don't vote for kings. What do you mean? Bloody Peasant! I am your king. Well, I didn't vote for
						you. Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed!

						Bloody Peasant! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! Now, look here, my
						good man. I dunno. Must be a king.
